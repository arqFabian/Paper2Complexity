Methodology Process Flowchart: This flowchart outlines the key steps in the framework for assessing facade complexity and user perception in architectural design. It focuses on three main components: `Complexity Analysis System Development' (Section~\ref{subsec:ComplexitySystemDevelopment}), `Experiment Execution' (Section~\ref{subsec:Experiment_execution}), and `Data Analysis and Validation' (Section~\ref{subsec:Data_analysis}). The flowchart illustrates the transition from the `3D Modeling' step (Section~\ref{subsubsec:3DModeling},Figure~\ref{fig:modeling_flowchart}) to the use of the `CICA system' (Section~\ref{subsubsec:CICAsystem}, element 2, Figure~\ref{fig:CICA_and_VR_flowchart}), followed by the `VR Integration' step (Section~\ref{subsubsec:VR_integration},element 1, Figure~\ref{fig:CICA_and_VR_flowchart}), and concludes with the `Experiment Execution' and `Data Analysis' phases (elements 4 and 5, Figure~\ref{fig:Experiment_and_Data_Analysis_flowchart}). A detailed version of this `Unified Methodology Process' can be found in Appendix~\ref{fig:Detailed_Methodology_Flowchart}.

    Side-by-side comparison of the actual Architectural Environment Building exterior (a) and interior (c) with its detailed 3D virtual counterpart (b, d) created for the VR experiment for Facade Complexity Analysis, demonstrating the fidelity of the digital model in replicating architectural nuances. For clarity, the simulated interior (d) has been simplified to reduce distractions. Table of Facade Pattern Variations: This table presents samples of 3D-modeled building facades at levels 1, 3, and 9, showcasing the progression and differentiation within the ten facade variations as detailed in section~\ref{subsubsec:3DModeling}. The incremental complexity introduced at each selected variation is highlighted across three distinct patterns. For a comprehensive record of all variations, refer to~\ref{sec:AnnexVariations}.}
3D Modeling Flowchart: This flowchart outlines the process of creating a detailed 3D model of the Architectural Environment Research Building and its facade variations, developed in Blender (v3.6), detailed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:3DModeling}. The process includes geolocation, terrain modeling, and both exterior and interior virtual replication (a-d). Facade complexity is systematically generated (e,f) by applying parametric operations to three facade patterns—Hishi, Tortoise, and Asanoha (P1, P2, P3)—resulting in 10 variations for each pattern (g-i), showcasing increasing complexity (j-l).  This setup allows for the integration of the 3D models into the VR environment and CICA system for complexity assessment. For a comprehensive record of all variations, across the three distinct patterns, refer to~\ref{sec:AnnexVariations}.
