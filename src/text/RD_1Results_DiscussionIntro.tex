% Intro ===============

Building upon the methodologies outlined in the previous sections, this section presents findings from two primary sources: the application of the CICA system to a historical dataset of architectural images across various epochs and styles, and data collected from the experiment designed to gauge user responses to facade complexity.
Organized according to the goals set forth in the introduction, this section elucidates the evolving relationship between users and architectural complexity, providing valuable insights for future construction practices and the quantification of complexity in facade design.


%!Goals oriented discussion


%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Analyze historical architectural trends to discern the oscillation between complexity and simplicity.
%    \item {Apply the CICA system to quantitatively assess facade complexity across architectural eras.}
%    \item {Utilize VR to measure user tolerance and preference for complexity in facade design.}
%    \item \textbf{Investigate the alignment of user preferences with current trends in the AEC industry, especially concerning digital fabrication.}
%    \item \textbf{Provide actionable insights on the future of architectural design and construction, guided by empirical data on user preferences and technological capabilities.}
%\end{itemize}
