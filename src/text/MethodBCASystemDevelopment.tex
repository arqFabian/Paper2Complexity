The VR system developed for this study plays a pivotal role in our experiment, enabling participants to immerse themselves in a world where they can explore and interact with facades of varying complexity levels.

The system comprises three integral components (see Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}):

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{3D Modeling:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:3DModeling} and labeled as (1) in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, this component is responsible for creating realistic 3D representations of the experiment site and ten distinct facade variations across three patterns for user interaction.

\item \textbf{CICA System for 3D-Modeled Facades Analysis:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:CICAfor3DmodeledFacades} and labeled as (2) in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, the CICA system (as detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:Computational Image Complexity analysis}) provides complexity scores for the 3D-modeled facades.
This ensures a systematic approach to evaluating and selecting facade designs for the VR experience.

\item \textbf{VR Integration:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:VR_integration} and labeled as (3) in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, this component, developed using Unity, offers an immersive simulation with a data visualization interface.
Participants can navigate the virtual space, experiencing the building and its surroundings, and interact with various facade designs.
Real-time feedback enhances this interaction by showing the impact of different facade variations.
\end{enumerate}

Together, these components form a comprehensive system that leverages 3D modeling, data visualization, and virtual reality to recreate varying levels of facade complexity within building designs.
This system enables a thorough exploration of architectural complexity preferences.

Having outlined the VR system for complexity analysis in facade design, we will now delve into the specifics of its three fundamental components.

%As we delve into the realm of virtual reality (VR), our next undertaking involves the development of the VR Complexity Analysis system for facade design.
%This innovative system will play a pivotal role in our experiment, enabling participants to immerse themselves in a world where they can explore and interact with facades of varying complexity levels.
%
%The primary objective of the VR Complexity Analysis system is to capture user preferences and tolerance thresholds related to facade complexity.
%It achieves this by creating an immersive virtual environment designed to investigate architectural complexity preferences.
%
%To accomplish this ambitious goal, the system integrates three key components, as depicted in Figure\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}: 3D modeling, the application of the Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) system, and VR integration.
%
%The ``3D modeling'' module, developed in Blender (v3.6), serves as the initial component.
%Its role is to simulate the site and building where our experiment will take place and generate ten distinct facade variations for each of the three distinctive patterns.
%This capability empowers the system to create realistic, detailed 3D models of the facades in question, allowing participants to gain a deeper understanding of their spatial impact within the environment.
%
%The second vital component is the application of the Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) system, implemented in Python and seamlessly integrated into the Blender (v3.6) environment.
%The CICA system plays a central role by providing complexity scores for various iterations of 3D-modeled facade variations (see section\ref{subsec:Image Complexity analysis}).
%This systematic approach establishes an organized framework for evaluating facade design iterations, creating a selection process and hierarchy for the facade designs to be integrated into the VR experience.
%
%Finally, the `Virtual reality integration' module, developed in Unity, serves as the third critical component.
%This module includes an immersive simulation and a data visualization interface that transports users into the VR simulation of the experiment's location for facade complexity analysis.
%
%Within this dynamic virtual environment, participants can explore and interact with the building from both inside and outside, visualize its context, and manipulate the facade variations through the user interface.
%
%Seamlessly integrated with the simulation, the interface provides real-time feedback on the impact of different facade variations on the building, facilitating more effective and informed decision-making when selecting a specific level of complexity.
%
%Together, these components form a comprehensive system that leverages 3D modeling, data visualization, and virtual reality to recreate varying levels of facade complexity within building designs, enabling a thorough exploration of architectural complexity preferences.
%
%Now that we have outlined the overarching vision for our VR Complexity Analysis system in facade design, let's delve into the specifics of its three fundamental components.
