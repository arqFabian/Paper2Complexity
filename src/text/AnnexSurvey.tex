The evaluation survey had two sections.
The first one tasked with identifying the professional background of the participants (see Table\ref{tab:BackgroundSurvey}).
The second one, a 10 question survey using a 7-point Likert scale to measure the degree of complexity and pattern arrangement within facade design  tailored for digital fabrication (see Table\ref{tab:ComplexitySurvey}).
