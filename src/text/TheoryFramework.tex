%% Research Background

%% A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article already dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation for further work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical development from a theoretical basis.

%A theoretical framework is a foundational review of existing theories that serves as a roadmap for developing the arguments you will use in your own work.

%% Introduction

%kept intro
Architecture, as a reflection of society, has continually evolved to accommodate the needs of the communities it shelters.
Buildings, in essence, serve as tools with a purpose—guardians of societies, nurturers of generations, and manifestations of future aspirations.

Critique is inherent to architecture, and it falls upon successive generations to discern flaws within the inherited built environment.
Amidst these legacies, the legacy of the modernist movement, emerging in the mid-20th century, emerges as particularly relevant.
Anchored in principles of simplicity and the maxim ``form follows function'', this movement gained global prominence, addressing urbanization challenges triggered by rural migration to cities.

Yet, this era's legacy brings forth a profound debate.
While remarkable creations emerged, it's important not to label nearly a century of architectural style as universally negative.
However, society acknowledges the unintended consequences.

The fervor for uniformity and functionalism, epitomized by the modernism style of the 20th century, led to a disconnect from cultural roots.
As cities embraced this discourse, they lost distinct identities, homogenizing urban landscapes and erasing their unique memories.

As Venturi\cite{Venturi1972} explains learning from  the existing landscape  is  a  way of being revolutionary for  an  architect, not the obvious way, which is to tear down the existing city and start again, but another, more tolerant way;
that is, to question how we look at things.

% concise intro
This research delves into the complex narrative of architecture, exploring the interplay between innovation, utility, and cultural heritage.
We aim to understand how architectural styles, while diverse in their approaches, contribute to the cultural essence and identity of urban spaces.
Gage's\cite{Gage2015} perspective reinforces the importance of architecture in the modern world, where it must transcend mere functionality to resonate with societal trends and values.

Our theoretical framework navigates the historical oscillations between architectural complexity and simplicity, examining the role of facades in embodying the identity of structures.
We also investigate the impact of digital fabrication and parametric design, along with the role of mixed reality in enhancing architectural design processes.

This framework guides our exploration into how architectural evolution interacts with societal dynamics, seeking insights into fostering a harmonious relationship between built environments and their inhabitants

%
% Because as Gage~\cite{Gage2015} eloquently puts it ``If architecture is to exist in the 21st century, when attention is focused on the fast-paced worlds of technology, fashion, and entertainment, it must not recede into the background as mere functional equipment''.

%Each component within this theory framework contributes to our understanding of the intricate interplay between architectural evolution and societal dynamics.
%As we navigate through complexities and contemplate the subtleties of design paradigms, we seek to uncover insights that illuminate the path to a more harmonious relationship between built environments and the people who inhabit them.
