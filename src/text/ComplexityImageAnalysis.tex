We have previously stated the argument that the history of architecture, and the essence of architecture evolution, consists of an ever-changing interplay between simplicity and complexity.

we have explored the theoretical definition and revisioned the different approach towards facades and ornamentation from the perspective of some of the most prominant architectural style across history and the views of their most recognized representatives.

the conclusion from this literature analysis was that the current trend in architecture tilts towards a new revival of complexity however it might look like a suibjective view and insinuate perhaps some biased towards this outcome .

for this reason an additional quantitatvie analysis using Image complexity analysis was conducted using as input images of the most representative buildings across epochs and styles.

For this the complexity image analysis that assigns a complexity value governed by the complexity definition that Complexity of an image is governed by spatial, frequency and color information present in the image.

Scanpath based image complexity analysis determines human visual behavior that could lead to development of interactive and intelligent systems.\cite{Ishrat2020}

The objective of current research work is to establish the complexity of the given set of images while target objects are searched and to present analysis ofgaze search pattern.
To achieve these objectives a remote gaze estimation and analysis model has been proposed for scanpath identification and analysis.\cite{Ishrat2020}
