%\label{subsec:ComplexityStudies}

Previous research has extensively explored the impact of complexity in architectural design, showing that elements such as chaotic patterns and fractal geometry significantly influence user perceptions and aesthetic preferences~\cite{Bies2016}.
Contemporary studies suggest that balanced complexity can create environments that are both stimulating and comfortable~\cite{Redies2015}.
However, the architectural field has yet to fully develop frameworks that leverage these principles for practical design applications, particularly with modern technological advancements.

A foundational theoretical contribution to understanding architectural complexity is George David Birkhoff's theory of aesthetic measure, introduced in 1933.
Birkhoff proposed that aesthetic value could be quantified through a ratio of order to complexity, expressed as M = O/C (where M is the aesthetic measure, O is order, and C is complexity)\cite{Douchova2016}.

This balance is central to contemporary efforts to integrate complexity into architectural design, enhancing both user satisfaction and sustainability.
This theory offered architects a novel way to think about design as a balance between simplicity and ornamentation, reflecting the need for structure in increasingly complex designs.
Although this framework has limitations in its applicability to modern technological contexts, it remains a cornerstone for evaluating the aesthetic appeal of architectural forms and guiding the integration of complexity into functional design\cite{Javaheri2016}.

Alexander et al.~’s concept of `pattern language,' introduced in the 1970s, emphasizes the importance of recurring design patterns that resonate fundamentally with human users~\cite{Alexander1977}.
This theory emerged in response to the chaotic urban developments of the mid-20th century, seeking to find a harmonious balance in the built environment.
By focusing on universal patterns that align with human perception, Alexander laid the groundwork for biophilic design principles, which emphasize the integration of natural elements into architectural spaces to enhance human well-being~\cite{Downton2017}.

Browning et al.~(2014) extended this research in facade design by emphasizing the importance of balancing complexity and order in architectural design and demonstrating the importance of fractal geometries in creating environments that are visually engaging yet stress-reducing.
Their studies found that specific fractal dimensions (D=1.3-1.8), found in nature, art, and architecture, are preferred by users for their ability to convey order and intrigue~\cite{Browning2014}.
However, they caution against the extremes of non-fractal or overly complex designs, which can induce stress or discomfort.
This work offers practical guidance for architects seeking to incorporate complexity in a way that promotes psychological and cognitive well-being.

A more recent method by Lee et al.~(2023) uses fractal dimension analysis to measure the visual complexity of architectural facades, which is crucial for assessing aesthetic character and predicting attractiveness.
They utilized the differential box counting method, which is better suited for handling greyscale images, to calculate fractal dimensions based on grey-level variations.
These fractal dimension values are then used to predict human visual preferences, providing a reliable measure of visual complexity in architectural design~\cite{Lee2023}.
Their method provides an objective, computational approach to understanding the aesthetic impact of complex forms, particularly useful in the context of digital fabrication and parametric design.
Lee et al.~concluded that computational measures of visual complexity (fractal dimensions) and attractive strength (visual attention simulation) can effectively quantify the visual attractiveness of architectural facades.
Their findings indicate that these measures can distinguish different architectural styles, despite some limitations.
Importantly, they found that visual complexity (D) and attractive strength (S) are not mathematically correlated, suggesting that engagement and appeal may be independent qualities.
By predicting human visual preferences, Lee’s work offers architects a tool for refining facade complexity in real-time design scenarios.
Though their proposed model for predicting visual attractiveness, A = D × S, will require further validation~\cite{Lee2023}.

Contemporary research continues to build on these theoretical foundations, exploring how advanced technologies like BIM and computational design methods can be used to create complex designs that are not only aesthetically but functionally effective,optimized for performance and sustainability~\cite{Leach2016}.
While these tools allow architects to push boundaries, the principles established by earlier theories remain relevant in guiding the balance between complexity and usability.

In summary, the evolution of architectural complexity reflects an ongoing interplay between cultural, technological, and theoretical influences.
From ancient grandiosity to modern minimalism and contemporary innovation, architects have continually sought to balance order and complexity to create meaningful and engaging built environments.

Theoretical frameworks such as Birkhoff's aesthetic measure, Alexander's pattern language, and Lee et al.'s fractal dimension analysis provide valuable insights into how complexity can be harnessed to enhance architectural design.
However, these theories must now be adapted to incorporate the dynamic capabilities of modern tools, offering architects the ability to interact with complexity in real-time.

Despite these advancements, a notable gap remains in translating theoretical insights into interactive design tools that respond dynamically to user feedback.
Current methodologies often lack the ability to provide real-time evaluations of facade complexity, limiting their relevance in contemporary, fast-paced design environments.
Real-time interaction enables architects and designers to assess complexity dynamically, making adjustments during the design process rather than relying solely on post-design evaluations~\cite{Krietemeyer2019}.
This capability is particularly valuable in environments where client preferences and functional requirements frequently shift.
Immediate feedback on the impact of complexity on both aesthetic and functional outcomes leads to more informed decision-making and optimized designs.

While tools like Shared Realities~\cite{Krietemeyer2019} demonstrated the potential of integrating real-time feedback into the design process, they remain limited in scope.
These tools often fall short of fully integrating environmental factors or the full complexity of design feedback into decision-making workflows, highlighting the need for more comprehensive, real-time responsive systems.

My research aims to bridge this gap by providing a more integrated, real-time approach to facade complexity analysis.
By developing a comprehensive system that combines immersive VR experiences with CV algorithms embedded in the CICA system this study offers a solution that allows architects to quantify facade complexity in an interactive and dynamic manner.
Unlike existing tools, this system not only evaluates complexity but also incorporates real-time user feedback, enabling designers to optimize complexity levels while accounting for both aesthetic and functional considerations.
In doing so, this research pushes the boundaries of interactive design by offering architects the ability to make informed, data-driven decisions that respond to shifting user preferences and contemporary architectural practices.
