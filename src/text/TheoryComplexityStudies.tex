%\label{subsec:ComplexityStudies}

Previous research has extensively explored the impact of complexity in architectural design, showing that elements such as chaotic patterns and fractal geometry significantly influence user perceptions and aesthetic preferences~\cite{Bies2016}.
Contemporary studies suggest that balanced complexity can create environments that are both stimulating and comfortable~\cite{Redies2015}.
However, the architectural field has yet to fully develop frameworks that leverage these principles for practical design applications, particularly with modern technological advancements.

A foundational theoretical contribution to understanding architectural complexity is George David Birkhoff's theory of aesthetic measure, introduced in 1933.
Birkhoff proposed that aesthetic value could be quantified through a ratio of order to complexity, expressed as M = O/C (where M is the aesthetic measure, O is order, and C is complexity)\cite{Douchova2016}.
This theory provided a framework for evaluating the aesthetic appeal of architectural forms based on their structural and decorative elements.
Despite challenges to the validity of Birkhoff's method for penalizing complexity, the concepts of order and complexity, along with objective quantification methods, remain significant in aesthetic evaluation functions\cite{Javaheri2016}.
This balance is central to contemporary efforts to integrate complexity into architectural design, enhancing both user satisfaction and sustainability.

Another significant theoretical framework is Alexander et al.~concept of `pattern language,' introduced in the 1970s~\cite{Alexander1977}.
Alexander et al.~emphasized the importance of recurring design patterns that resonate fundamentally with human users.
is theory suggests that certain patterns, when combined effectively, create environments that feel harmonious and alive, aligning with biophilic design principles that seek to connect architecture with natural elements to enhance human well-being~\cite{Downton2017}.

Browning et al.~(2014) contribute to this discussion by emphasizing the importance of balancing complexity and order in architectural design.
Their research highlights that visually engaging and information-rich spaces should strike a balance between being overly simplistic and overwhelmingly complex.
They draw from studies on fractal geometries found in nature, art, and architecture, suggesting that certain fractal dimensions (D=1.3-1.8) are preferred for their aesthetic and stress-reducing qualities~\cite{Browning2014}.
Fractal designs with three iterations are particularly effective in conveying a sense of order and intrigue.
These principles can be applied to various architectural elements to promote visually stimulating environments that support psychological and cognitive well-being.
However, they caution against the extremes of non-fractal or overly complex designs, which can induce stress or discomfort.
The goal is to integrate fractal geometries and hierarchies into design to create environments that are both engaging and restorative~\cite{Browning2014}.

A more recent method by Lee et al.~(2023) uses fractal dimension analysis to measure the visual complexity of architectural facades, which is crucial for assessing aesthetic character and predicting attractiveness.
They utilized the differential box counting method, which is better suited for handling greyscale images, to calculate fractal dimensions based on grey-level variations.
These fractal dimension values are then used to predict human visual preferences, providing a reliable measure of visual complexity in architectural design~\cite{Lee2023}.
Lee et al.~concluded that computational measures of visual complexity (fractal dimensions) and attractive strength (visual attention simulation) can effectively quantify the visual attractiveness of architectural facades.
Their findings indicate that these measures can distinguish different architectural styles, despite some limitations.
Importantly, they found that visual complexity (D) and attractive strength (S) are not mathematically correlated, suggesting that engagement and appeal may be independent qualities.
The proposed model for predicting visual attractiveness, A = D Ã— S, will require further validation.
This study highlights the significant influence of visual attractiveness on perceptions of architecture and the need to evaluate these attributes during the design process~\cite{Lee2023}.

Contemporary research continues to build on these theoretical foundations, exploring how advanced technologies can be used to create complex designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective.
The integration of digital tools such as BIM and computational design methods has enabled architects to push the boundaries of complexity, creating structures that are not only visually striking but also optimized for performance and sustainability, offering visually stimulating and experientially rich environments~\cite{Leach2016}~(Figure~\ref{fig:contemporarytimeline}).

In summary, the evolution of architectural complexity reflects an ongoing interplay between cultural, technological, and theoretical influences.
From ancient grandiosity to modern minimalism and contemporary innovation, architects have continually sought to balance order and complexity to create meaningful and engaging built environments.
Theoretical frameworks such as Birkhoff's aesthetic measure, Alexander's pattern language, and Lee et al.'s fractal dimension analysis provide valuable insights into harnessing complexity to enhance architectural design, offering a foundation for future explorations in this dynamic field.

Despite significant advancements in understanding architectural complexity and its impact on user perceptions, there remains a notable gap in the integration of theoretical insights with practical applications in the context of modern technological advancements.
Current methodologies often lack the ability to provide real-time, interactive evaluations of facade complexity, limiting their applicability in dynamic design environments.

\added{
Real-time interaction enables architects and designers to assess complexity dynamically, making adjustments during the design process rather than relying solely on post-design evaluations~\cite{Krietemeyer2019}. This capability is particularly valuable in environments where client preferences and functional requirements frequently shift. Immediate feedback on the impact of complexity on both aesthetic and functional outcomes leads to more informed decision-making and optimized designs.
While tools like Shared Realities~\cite{Krietemeyer2019} demonstrated the potential of integrating real-time feedback into the design process, they remain limited in scope. Shared Realities links designers to dynamic conditions through real-time user feedback, but its application is still developing, particularly regarding its ability to fully integrate environmental impacts into design decisions. This example highlights the potential for responsive design systems, yet underscores the need for further advancement to create comprehensive, fully interactive workflows that can accommodate the complexities of modern architectural practice.

My research aims to bridge this gap by developing a comprehensive system that combines immersive VR experiences with CV algorithms embedded in the CICA system \added{developed for this study}.
This approach allows for the quantification of facade complexity in a way that is both interactive and responsive to user feedback, providing a practical tool for architects to optimize design complexity while considering aesthetic and functional aspects.
By incorporating advanced digital tools and empirical data, this research seeks to enhance the understanding of how complexity can be effectively managed and utilized in contemporary architectural practices.
