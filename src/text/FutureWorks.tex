%% recommendations: Avenues for further studies or analyses

        %% Based on the discussion of your results, you can make recommendations for practical implementation or further research. Sometimes, the recommendations are saved for the conclusion. Suggestions for further research can lead directly from the limitations. Don’t just state that more studies should be done—give concrete ideas for how future work can build on areas that your own research was unable to address.

The insights into the cultural and historical significance of facades underscore the importance of context in architectural complexity analysis.
In improving the CICA system's assessments, we must consider for future iterations not only the quantitative complexity of a facade but also its cultural resonance and historical context, ensuring a holistic evaluation of architectural evolution.
