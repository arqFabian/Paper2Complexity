This research investigates architectural design at the intersection of digital fabrication, virtual reality (VR) assessment, and computer vision, aiming to deepen our understanding of complexity in facade design.
Our primary goal is to gauge user tolerance and acceptance of complex facades, offering insights into future construction practices.

A literature review confirmed that contemporary architecture is witnessing a trend towards increasing complexity in facade designs, moving away from the minimalist approach of the modernist movement, a trend also evidenced by the quantitative analysis across architectural history, provided by the `Computational Image Complexity Analysis' (CICA) system, which revealed an upward complexity trendline since the late 20th century (see Figure~\ref{fig:CICAscatterGraphRender}).
The historical analysis using the CICA system underscored the cultural and historical significance of facades, indicating that architectural complexity is not merely a matter of quantitative metrics but also involves cultural resonance and historical context.

Participants in the virtual reality experiment showed a preference for facades with moderate complexity, suggesting that future architectural trends may favor designs that balance intricacy with simplicity.
On average, participants favor a moderate level of complexity, with an average CICA complexity score of 3.82 (out of 10) and a 40\% probability of selecting a score close to this value according to CICA\@.

Discrepancies between participant perceptions and the CICA system's complexity rankings were particularly evident at higher complexity levels.
This highlights the subjective nature of complexity perception and the importance of integrating human feedback into architectural assessments.

The qualitative data suggests a shift towards customizable and user-responsive architectural solutions, with participants favoring form over materials and expressing a preference for facades that consider views and privacy.
This feedback suggests a strategic, view-dependent approach to facade complexity is crucial for user satisfaction.

In conclusion, this study underscores a shift in contemporary architecture towards embracing complexity in facade design, moving beyond the minimalist constraints of the modernist movement.
These insights could inform the development of nuanced and user-centric approaches in architectural design, catering to the evolving demands of modern society.
