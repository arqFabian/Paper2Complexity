Recent advancements in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and digital fabrication are transforming architectural practice.
These technologies enable architects to design intricate and complex forms, moving beyond the uniformity of barren walls and fully glazed facades that often dominate contemporary streetscapes.
By leveraging these advancements, architects can introduce complexity and detail into their designs, enhancing both the visual and functional aspects of buildings, and creating more engaging and dynamic environments that potentially redefine the relationship between form and function~\cite{Leach2016}.

However, the pursuit of complexity in architectural design must be balanced with sustainability and user satisfaction.
Designs that are overly complex without consideration of these factors can quickly become outdated and disconnected from their inhabitants, leading to issues of obsolescence and lack of relevance~\cite{Oberfrancova2021}.
Understanding how complexity can enhance both environmental sustainability and user satisfaction is therefore crucial for modern architectural practice.

Previous research has extensively explored the impact of complexity in architectural design, identifying mathematical relationships between complexity and aesthetic value ~\cite{Bies2016, Douchova2016, Redies2015}.
Despite these insights, the architectural field has yet to develop frameworks that leverage these principles for practical design applications, especially considering modern technological advancements aimed at sustainability.

This study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application by developing a methodology to measure facade complexity.
The objectives are to generate data that can improve `Data-driven Building Design' (DBD) by integrating a complexity scoring function that can inform on the optimal rate between simplicity and complexity based on historical analysis and user preferences.
By integrating complexity insights with modern technological applications, we seek to provide actionable, DBD insights for future architectural practices promoting the advancement aimed at sustainability.

The methodology is structured around 4 primary components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literature review: Significant studies on the foundational theories of complexity, and an exploration of the fluctuation between simplicity and complexity in architectural history.
    \item Complexity Analysis System Development: Implements a Virtual Reality (VR) framework, and combines it with a Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) component using computer vision (CV) algorithms to quantitatively assess the complexity of facade designs.
    \item Experiment Execution: involving VR to facilitate participant interaction with complex facades, augmented by surveys and interviews for qualitative insight.
    \item Data Analysis and Validation: Assessing the data collected during the experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the Complexity Analysis System and CICA framework in measuring complexity and user preferences.
\end{enumerate}

This comprehensive approach aims to enrich our understanding of facade complexity and its role in the contemporary Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.
