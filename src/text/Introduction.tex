%=================================

In an era where computer-aided design and digital fabrication are revolutionizing the field of architecture, our study embarks on a timely exploration of society's receptiveness to embracing more intricate and ornamented architectural designs.
This potential shift away from the prevalent uniformity in urban landscapes poses a challenge to the traditional principle that `form follows function'\cite{Gage2015}, suggesting a rekindled interest in architectural complexity and ornamentation.

This research aims to evaluate contemporary receptivity to architectural complexity, leveraging digital fabrication to propose a departure from uniform urban design towards uniquely intricate structures.
We question the extent to which modern audiences are prepared to accept and value such complexity in the built environment.
To achieve our research objectives, we employ a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative analysis with qualitative insights.
The methodology is structured around four primary components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literature review: to contextualize the fluctuation between simplicity and complexity in architectural history to infer future directions.
    \item Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA): created using computer vision algorithms to quantitatively assess the complexity of facade designs, providing data to support theoretical discussions on architectural complexity.
    \item Virtual Reality (VR) Simulation Development: Implements a VR framework for interactive exploration with varied degrees of complexity in facade design, collecting user perceptions and preferences.
    \item Experiment Design: involving VR to facilitate participant interaction with complex facades, augmented by surveys and interviews for qualitative insight.
\end{enumerate}

The research aims to identify the balance between simplicity and complexity in architecture by integrating historical insights with modern technological applications.
We hypothesized that, this immersive experience will not only enrich our understanding of facade complexity but also reveal the relationship between user preferences and the evolving trends in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry for more elaborate designs.

Therefore, the main aims of this study will be as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyze historical architectural trends to discern the oscillation between complexity and simplicity.
    \item Apply the CICA system to quantitatively assess facade complexity across architectural eras.
    \item Utilize VR to measure user tolerance and preference for complexity in facade design.
    \item Investigate the alignment of user preferences with current trends in the AEC industry, especially concerning digital fabrication.
    \item Examine the influence of societal values and technological advances on architectural aesthetics, aiming to identify preferences for complexity versus simplicity.
    \item Provide actionable insights on the future of architectural design and construction, guided by empirical data on user preferences and technological capabilities.
\end{itemize}



In summary, this research aims to bridge the theoretical understanding of architectural complexity with practical insights gained through contemporary simulation technologies.
By examining architectural complexity through the lens of user preferences, this study seeks to inform and influence the future direction of architectural design and construction practices, ensuring they are aligned with both aesthetic values and functional demands.


%We find ourselves at a pivotal juncture in history, as the emergence of computer-aided design converges with the industrialization of construction, ushering in a new paradigm in architectural design.

%In response to the prevailing state of one-size-fits-all in building design, this paper will embark on an exploration—a quest to see the reaction of occupants to reintroducing ornamentation and identity to our urban spaces by means of digital fabrication.

%We start by delving into the complexity debate, drawing upon expert insights and historical architectural analysis.
%Our exploration of influential architectural styles seeks to identify a recurring pattern—an oscillation between simplicity and complexity.

%We believe, this pattern will reflect the essence of architectural evolution—an ever-changing interplay between simplicity and complexity.
%To substantiate this, we will employ computer vision to quantitatively assess facade design complexity, to provide empirical evidence of the cyclic shift between simplicity and complexity across architectural eras to prove how this enduring pattern underscores the interplay between societal values and transformative technological developments.

%Amidst this transformative pursuit, the advent of mixed reality technology offers a portal to vividly convey the vision of future architectural design.
%We hypothesize that immersing stakeholders in a virtual realm where digital fabrication converges with artistry and functionality, a shared understanding of the virtues of complexity can be nurtured.

%Through this immersive experience, stakeholders gain firsthand insight into the reimagining of conventional construction methods, especially as the democratization of 3D printing houses and other digital fabrication techniques looms on the horizon.

%In this context, this research aims to explore  how users respond to complex facades crafted through  digital fabrication techniques.
%Through the medium of a virtual reality experiment, the study seeks to refine our comprehension of complex Facade Design.

%By delving into this user-centric exploration,  the research aims to uncover potential interconnections between these insights and predictions related to Future Construction Trends.

%In doing so, this study aspires to unravel the intricate web that links user preferences, architectural design intricacy, and the trajectory of forthcoming construction practices.

%Hence, this research sets out to address a pivotal question: What degree of complexity and pattern arrangement within facade design, generated through a data-driven design process tailored for digital fabrication, would users tolerate and accept for a building?



%The hypothesis posits that participants, regardless of their professional backgrounds and preexisting knowledge of facade design, would provide the essential data needed to refine our grasp of complex facade design through engagement in a Virtual Reality experiment (VR).

%Moreover, this data would lay the groundwork for predicting whether the shift towards intricate ornamentation will indeed shape the future trends of construction, as evidenced by the configurations they contribute.

%By embracing complexity and transcending the boundaries of mass-produced uniformity, we embrace an opportunity to infuse renewed vibrancy into urban environments, rekindling the spirit of ornamentation and identity, and fostering a sustainable aesthetic inspired by the magnificence of the natural world.

%Yet, a question arises: Is contemporary society prepared to once again embrace the realms of ornamentation and complexity, following decades of architectural adherence to the guiding principle of ``form follows function''\cite{Gage2015}, which still wields significant influence over contemporary architectural practices?

%To explore this question, our literature review delves into the complexity debate, drawing upon expert insights and historical architectural analysis.
%As we explore influential architectural styles, we will look for a pattern that recognizes the dynamic oscillation between simplicity and complexity.

%Our exploration of influential architectural styles seeks to identify a recurring pattern—an oscillation between simplicity and complexity that characterizes architectural evolution.
%This pattern is shaped by the interplay of societal values and technological advancements.

%Consider, for instance, the transition from the Romanesque style of the 10th century to the intricate complexity of the Gothic style that flourished in the 14th century\cite{Arora2023}(see Figure\ref{fig:RomanesquevsGothic}).



%Similarly, the elaborate Art Deco architecture of the 1920s stands in stark contrast to the subsequent embrace of simplicity of Modern Architecture and rationalism  of the mid-20th century that championed functionalism and minimalist aesthetics, showcasing innovative materials like steel, glass, and concrete\cite{Stacbond2020}.

%The advent of computer Aid design paired with the already established industrialization of construction, brought in during the creation of the rationalism movement on the 20th century, has provoked a new paradigm shift in the architecture design. The cult of the oversimplification and the ideas of functionality brought by their most canonical representative "Le Corbusier" that birthed cities alienated from the human centric design that had created urban spaces and society \cite{Stacbond2020} in favor for minimalistic approches following an industrial design that ppointed to the machine as the new model for building design \cite{Economakis2023}
