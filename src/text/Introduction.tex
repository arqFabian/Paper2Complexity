Recent advancements in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and digital fabrication are transforming architectural practice.
These technologies enable architects to design intricate and complex forms, challenging the traditional minimalist aesthetics.
By leveraging these advancements, architects can create detailed environments that potentially redefine the relationship between form and function~\cite{Gage2015}.

However, the pursuit of complexity in architectural design must be balanced with sustainability and user satisfaction.
Designs that are overly complex without consideration of these factors can quickly become outdated and disconnected from their inhabitants, leading to issues of obsolescence and lack of relevance~\cite{Aesthetic2022}.
Understanding how complexity can enhance both environmental sustainability and user satisfaction is therefore crucial for modern architectural practice.


Previous research has extensively explored the impact of complexity in architectural design, showing that elements such as chaotic patterns and fractal geometry significantly influence user perceptions and aesthetic preferences~\cite{Bies2016}.
Birkhoff's mathematical formalization of the ratio of order to complexity has been instrumental in understanding aesthetic value~\cite{Birkhoff1933}.
Contemporary studies build on these foundations, suggesting that balanced complexity can create environments that are both stimulating and comfortable~\cite{Redies2015}.
Despite these insights, the architectural field has yet to fully develop frameworks that leverage these principles for practical design applications, particularly in the context of modern technological advancements.

This study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application by developing a methodology to measure facade complexity.
The objectives are to generate data that can improve data-driven optimization models for building design, identify an optimal balance between simplicity and complexity that aligns with user preferences, and enhance sustainability.
By integrating historical insights with modern technological applications, we seek to provide actionable, data-driven insights for future architectural practices.

To achieve our research objectives, we employ a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative analysis with qualitative insights.
The methodology is structured around four primary components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literature review: Significant studies that have assessed aesthetic preferences related to complexity, such as the impact of chaotic patterns and fractal geometry on user perceptions, and an exploration of the fluctuation between simplicity and complexity in architectural history to infer future directions.
    \item Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA): created using computer vision algorithms to quantitatively assess the complexity of facade designs, providing data to support theoretical discussions on architectural complexity.
    \item Virtual Reality (VR) Simulation Development: Implements a VR framework for interactive exploration with varied degrees of complexity in facade design, collecting user perceptions and preferences.
    \item Experiment Design: involving VR to facilitate participant interaction with complex facades, augmented by surveys and interviews for qualitative insight.
\end{enumerate}

This comprehensive approach aims to enrich our understanding of facade complexity and its role in the contemporary Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.

In summary, this research develops a methodology to measure facade complexity using CICA and VR simulations, aiming to balance simplicity and complexity in architectural design.
 By integrating historical and modern insights, we provide data-driven recommendations to enhance sustainability and user satisfaction in future architectural practices.
