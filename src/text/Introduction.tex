%=================================

The emergence of computer-aided design and digital fabrication could herald a resurgence of intricate and ornate architectural design within our societal fabric, potentially offering an alternative to the uniformity most commonly seen in today's urban landscapes.

Yet, a pivotal question arises: Is contemporary society prepared to once again embrace the realms of ornamentation and complexity, following decades of architectural adherence to the guiding principle of ``form follows function''\cite{Gage2015}, which still wields significant influence over contemporary architectural practices?

To explore this question, our literature review delves into the complexity debate, offering expert insights.
As we explore influential architectural styles, a striking pattern emerges—a dynamic oscillation between simplicity and complexity.

Consider, for instance, the transition from the Romanesque style of the 10th century to the intricate complexity of the Gothic style that flourished in the 14th century\cite{Arora2023}(see Figure\ref{fig:RomanesquevsGothic}).

          \label{fig:RomanesquevsGothic}
        \end{figure}

Similarly, the elaborate Art Deco architecture of the 1920s stands in stark contrast to the subsequent embrace of simplicity of Modern Architecture and rationalism  of the mid-20th century that championed functionalism and minimalist aesthetics, showcasing innovative materials like steel, glass, and concrete\cite{Stacbond2020}.

We believe, this pattern reflects the essence of architectural evolution—an ever-changing interplay between simplicity and complexity, often shaped by the convergence of societal values and technological advancements.
To substantiate this, we employ computer vision to quantitatively assess facade design complexity, providing empirical evidence of the cyclic shift between simplicity and complexity across architectural eras.
This enduring pattern underscores the interplay between societal values and transformative technological developments.

Once again, we find ourselves at a pivotal juncture in history, as the emergence of computer-aided design converges with the industrialization of construction, ushering in a new paradigm in architectural design.

In response to the prevailing state of one-size-fits-all building design, this paper embarks on an exploration—a quest to reintroduce ornamentation and identity to our urban spaces by embracing the fusion of digital fabrication.

We believe that by harnessing the limitless potential of digital fabrication technology, architecture can rise above the constraints of mass production and rediscover its intricate origins, while ensuring that the results remain compelling and well-received by users.

Amidst this transformative pursuit, the advent of mixed reality technology offers a portal to vividly convey the vision of future architectural design.
We hypothesize that immersing stakeholders in a virtual realm where digital fabrication converges with artistry and functionality, a shared understanding of the virtues of complexity can be nurtured.

Through this immersive experience, stakeholders gain firsthand insight into the reimagining of conventional construction methods, especially as the democratization of 3D printing houses and other digital fabrication techniques looms on the horizon.

In this context, this research aims to explore  how users respond to complex facades crafted through  digital fabrication techniques.
Through the medium of a virtual reality experiment, the study seeks to refine our comprehension of complex Facade Design.

By delving into this user-centric exploration,  the research aims to uncover potential interconnections between these insights and predictions related to Future Construction Trends.

In doing so, this study aspires to unravel the intricate web that links user preferences, architectural design intricacy, and the trajectory of forthcoming construction practices.

Hence, this research sets out to address a pivotal question: What degree of complexity and pattern arrangement within facade design, generated through a data-driven design process tailored for digital fabrication, would users tolerate and accept for a building?

The hypothesis posits that participants, regardless of their professional backgrounds and preexisting knowledge of facade design, would provide the essential data needed to refine our grasp of complex facade design through engagement in a Virtual Reality experiment (VR).

Moreover, this data would lay the groundwork for predicting whether the shift towards intricate ornamentation will indeed shape the future trends of construction, as evidenced by the configurations they contribute.

By embracing complexity and transcending the boundaries of mass-produced uniformity, we embrace an opportunity to infuse renewed vibrancy into urban environments, rekindling the spirit of ornamentation and identity, and fostering a sustainable aesthetic inspired by the magnificence of the natural world.
