Recent advancements in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and digital fabrication are transforming architectural practice.
These technologies enable architects to design intricate and complex forms, moving beyond the uniformity of barren walls and fully glazed facades that often dominate contemporary streetscapes.
By leveraging these advancements, architects can introduce complexity and detail into their designs, enhancing both the visual and functional aspects of buildings, and creating more engaging and dynamic environments that potentially redefine the relationship between form and function~\cite{Leach2016}.

However, the pursuit of complexity in architectural design must be balanced with sustainability and user satisfaction.
Designs that are overly complex without consideration of these factors can quickly become outdated and disconnected from their inhabitants, leading to issues of obsolescence and lack of relevance~\cite{Oberfrancova2021}.
Understanding how complexity can enhance both environmental sustainability and user satisfaction is therefore crucial for modern architectural practice.

However, the pursuit of complexity in architectural design must be balanced with sustainability and user satisfaction.
Overly complex designs, when not thoughtfully integrated, can quickly become outdated, contributing to obsolescence and construction waste, a major source of carbon emissions~\cite{Oberfrancova2021}.
By incorporating complexity analysis into the design process and controlling and optimizing facade complexity, architects can create designs that are not only visually engaging but also adaptable and long-lasting, reducing the need for frequent renovations and replacements.

Understanding the complexity of facade designs is crucial because facades are the most visible part of a building, playing a significant role in urban aesthetics and user perception. Designs that strike the right balance between simplicity and complexity can create environments that are not only visually stimulating but also comfortable and functional for occupants~\cite{Browning2014}. Complexity can enhance the user experience, making facades more engaging and improving user satisfaction with the built environment. Moreover, facade design can contribute to energy efficiency and material optimization, especially when combined with advanced technologies like digital fabrication and parametric design.

This study proposes the development of a system to measure and adjust facade complexity, which could be integrated with existing tools for energy efficiency, material optimization, and environmental comfort.
Such an approach could significantly minimize environmental impact while addressing the sustainability challenges in modern construction.
Understanding how complexity can enhance both environmental sustainability and user satisfaction is therefore crucial for modern architectural practice.

Previous research has extensively explored the impact of complexity in architectural design, identifying mathematical relationships between complexity and aesthetic value ~\cite{Bies2016, Douchova2016, Redies2015}.
Despite these insights, the architectural field has yet to develop frameworks that leverage these principles for practical design applications, especially considering modern technological advancements aimed at sustainability.

Despite these insights, the architectural field has yet to develop frameworks that leverage these principles for practical design applications, especially considering modern technological advancements such as digital fabrication and parametric design. These technologies not only enable the creation of complex forms but when paired with `Data-driven Building Design' (DBD) optimization they also support energy efficiency, material reduction, and long-term sustainability.

This study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application by developing a methodology to measure facade complexity.
The objectives are to generate data that can improve DBD by integrating a complexity scoring function that can inform on the optimal rate between simplicity and complexity based on historical analysis and user preferences.
By integrating complexity insights with modern technological applications, we seek to provide actionable, data-driven insights for future architectural practices promoting the advancement aimed at sustainability.

The methodology is structured around 4 primary components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literature review: Significant studies on the foundational theories of complexity, and an exploration of the fluctuation between simplicity and complexity in architectural history.
    \item Complexity Analysis System Development: \deleted{Implements a Virtual Reality (VR) framework, and combines it with a Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) component using computer vision (CV) algorithms to quantitatively assess the complexity of facade designs.}\added{This component integrates a Virtual Reality (VR) framework with the Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) system, specifically developed for this study. The CICA system utilizes computer vision (CV) algorithms to quantitatively assess facade design complexity.}
    \item Experiment Execution: involving VR to facilitate participant interaction with complex facades, augmented by surveys and interviews for qualitative insight.
    \item Data Analysis and Validation: Assessing the data collected during the experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the Complexity Analysis System and CICA framework in measuring complexity and user preferences.
\end{enumerate}

This comprehensive approach aims to enrich our understanding of facade complexity and its role in the contemporary Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.
