Recent advancements in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and digital fabrication are transforming architectural practice.
These technologies enable architects to design intricate and complex forms, moving beyond the uniformity of barren walls and fully glazed facades that often dominate contemporary streetscapes.
By leveraging these advancements, architects can introduce complexity and detail into their designs, enhancing both the visual and functional aspects of buildings, and creating more engaging and dynamic environments that potentially redefine the relationship between form and function~\cite{Gage2015}.

However, the pursuit of complexity in architectural design must be balanced with sustainability and user satisfaction.
Designs that are overly complex without consideration of these factors can quickly become outdated and disconnected from their inhabitants, leading to issues of obsolescence and lack of relevance~\cite{Aesthetic2022}.
Understanding how complexity can enhance both environmental sustainability and user satisfaction is therefore crucial for modern architectural practice.

Previous research has extensively explored the impact of complexity in architectural design, identifying a mathematical relationship between complexity and aesthetic value while emphasizing the importance of balanced complexity for creating environments that are both stimulating and comfortable~\cite{Bies2016, Birkhoff1933, Redies2015}.
Despite these insights, the architectural field has yet to develop frameworks that leverage these principles for practical design applications, especially considering modern technological advancements aimed at sustainability.

This study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application by developing a methodology to measure facade complexity.
The objectives are to generate data that can improve `Data-driven Building Design' (DBD) sustainable optimization models, identify an optimal balance between simplicity and complexity that aligns with user preferences, and enhance sustainability.
By integrating historical insights with modern technological applications, we seek to provide actionable, DBD insights for future architectural practices.

To achieve our research objectives, we employ a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative analysis with qualitative insights.
The methodology is structured around 4 primary components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literature review: Significant studies on the foundational theories of complexity in architecture, and an exploration of the fluctuation between simplicity and complexity in architectural history.
    \item Complexity System Development: Implements a Virtual Reality (VR) framework for interactive exploration with varied degrees of complexity in facade design, and combines it with a Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) component using computer vision (CV) algorithms to quantitatively assess the complexity of facade designs, providing data to support theoretical discussions on architectural complexity.
    \item Experiment Execution: involving VR to facilitate participant interaction with complex facades, augmented by surveys and interviews for qualitative insight.
    \item Data Analysis and Validation: Assessing the data collected during the experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the VR system and CICA framework in measuring complexity and user preferences.
\end{enumerate}

This comprehensive approach aims to enrich our understanding of facade complexity and its role in the contemporary Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.

In summary, this research develops a methodology to measure facade complexity using CICA and VR simulations, aiming to balance simplicity and complexity in architectural design.
 By integrating historical and modern insights, we provide data-driven recommendations to enhance sustainability and user satisfaction in future architectural practices.
