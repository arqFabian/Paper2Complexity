The second vital component is the application of the Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) system, implemented in Python and seamlessly integrated into the Blender (v3.6) environment.
The CICA system plays a central role by providing complexity scores for various iterations of 3D-modeled facade variations (see section \ref{subsec:Image Complexity analysis}).
This systematic approach establishes an organized framework for evaluating facade design iterations, creating a selection process and hierarchy for the facade designs to be integrated into the VR experience.
