% Intro ===============

Building upon the methodologies outlined in the previous sections, this `Results and Discussion' section presents findings from two main sources: the outcomes of applying our Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) system to a historical dataset of architectural images across various epochs and styles, and the insights gained from an experiment designed to gauge user responses to facade complexity.
Organized according to the goals set forth in the introduction, this section aims to elucidate the evolving relationship between users and architectural complexity, providing valuable insights for future construction practices and design paradigms.
