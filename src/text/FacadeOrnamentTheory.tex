%!==========================
%Delve deeper into how facades reflect cultural values, societal norms, and historical contexts. Explore how different societies and civilizations have expressed their identity through architectural ornamentation and symbolism.
%!==========================
We have established a foundation for the notion that contemporary architecture is gravitating towards a renaissance of complexity.
This resurgence is catalyzed by the utilization of technology and sophisticated software analyses, enabling the creation of innovative ornamentation that seamlessly integrates functionality with cultural heritage.
This evolution paves the way for the elaboration of intricate patterns that serve as a powerful medium to express the distinct identity of the local environment, thereby rejuvenating the urban landscape.

Transitioning into the focal point of this research, we delve into the trajectory of architectural complexity within the specific realm of facades.

Facades, a paramount architectural element, have held an enduring significance for centuries due to their role as the initial point of contact with a building, acting as a boundary between the interior and the exterior, working as an interface between the living spaces and the external climate, influencing comfort and energy efficiency\cite{Kamal2020} thereby acting as the primary medium through which the structure interacts with its surroundings (Figure\ref{fig:FacadeBaroqueVsContemporary}).

However, much like the broader scope of architecture, the role of ornamentation and facades has also undergone evolution and transformation throughout history.
To elucidate how various societies and civilizations have conveyed their identity through architectural ornamentation and symbolism, we embark on an exploration of the interpretations given to facades by some of the most influential architects and artists of their respective eras.

%%Facade according to vitruvius

Vitruvius, a celebrated Roman architect and military engineer, in 1st century BCE, author of ``De Architecura'', a series of ten books considered as the first treatise in architecture theory\cite{Kruft1994}.
Within this work, Vitruvius advocates for three essential attributes that a building should embody: ``firmitas'' (structural soundness), ``utilitas'' (functionality), and ``venustas'' (beauty or aesthetics)\cite{Ostwald2023}.

Vitruvius places emphasis primarily on Reason, and secondarily on proportions.
It's worth highlighting that the cultural atmosphere in ancient Rome during the late first century B.C favoured the understanding of the world as a well-structured and ordered whole\cite{Lefas2000}.

Facades partake of this reasoning and in accordance to Vitruvius should not only be visually appealing but should also reflect the underlying structural integrity of the building and fulfill its intended purpose effectively(Figure\ref{fig:Vitruvianarchitecture}).
In terms of ornamentation, Vitruvius seeks to approach this subjective realm, dominated by taste, with objectivity.
He rationalizes that a pleasing appearance emerges from the harmony and balance among the components that constitute a composition\cite{Lefas2000}.

        \label{fig:Vitruvianarchitecture}
    \end{figure}

Additionally, Vitruvius determines that the deciding factor for those components would follow the principle of ``Decor'',  the  fifth  principle on his system of values that elevates simple  building  practice  into  architecture, defined as the property that  deals  with  the  «appropriate»  articulation and construction of the work on principles respecting religion, nature and social conventions\cite{Lefas2000}.

In essence, according to Vitruvius, facades and their ornamentation stem from a sense of order and rationality.
They are achieved through a harmonious equilibrium of well-considered elements that adhere to established principles, while taking into account both tradition and nature.
This approach aims to achieve beauty while also effectively fulfilling the intended purpose of the facade.

Vitruvius's contributions would have a lasting impact on the field of construction spanning centuries.
However, his work remained largely dormant for a considerable period until its revival during the Renaissance, which encompassed the 14th to the 17th century.

This resurgence continued during the Neoclassical style of the 18th century and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts style of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
This series of revivals and reinterpretations led to the rekindling of Classical architecture in the years that followed\cite{Wikipedia2023}(Figure\ref{fig:ClassicismNeoClassicism}).

%%facade according to bernini and borromini
Moving beyond the Renaissance era and into the Baroque style, a significant shift in the perception of facades and ornamentation occurs.
Francesco Borromini, a prominent Italian architect of the Baroque period, emerges as a key figure in this context.

In his exploration of facades, Borromini emphasized the dynamic relationship between a building's interior and its facade, as a form of movement of matter beyond the body, precisely because the generation of form is internal to the object itself\cite{Benjamin2006}, therefore the facade should serve as a visual representation of the internal spaces and functions of the building.

Borromini's approach to facades went beyond mere decorative elements.
He saw the facade as an opportunity to express the inner workings and spatial organization of the building.
This concept is reflected in his designs, where facades often featured intricate geometric patterns, curved forms, and sculptural elements that hinted at the internal arrangements of rooms and structures(Figure\ref{fig:BorrominiArchitecture}).

        \end{figure}

``Exteriors which expressively display interiorities;
interiors which fold from within and, [\ldots] which appear to invite an exterior reading while presenting an interiorized text''\cite{Biglieri2004}.
In essence, Borromini's perspective on facades went beyond surface aesthetics;
he considered them as integral components of the architectural composition that could convey deeper meanings about the building's design and purpose.

%% context on bypassing neo classic and art deco

Exploring the historical evolution of facades and ornamentation necessitates acknowledging distinct periods that have significantly contributed to the advancement of architectural practice.

In the trajectory from Baroque to the transformative epoch of Modernism, various architectural styles emerged, yet none attained the global influence and profound impact comparable to the preceding Classicism, which drew inspiration from the ideals of Vitruvius, and subsequently Modernism on the 20th century would bring.

For the purpose of this research, before delving into the profound shifts of Modernism, it's crucial to acknowledge certain periods that contributed to architectural understanding without causing radical shifts.

Chronologically, the evolution from Baroque to Modernism included styles like Rococo, Neoclassical, Romanticism, Gothic Revival, Victorian, Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, and Art Deco, each leaving their mark on architectural expression.

Notably, Neo-Classicism, Art Nouveau, and Art Deco stand out as particularly influential periods.

The Neo-Classical style of the late 18th to early 19th centuries, with a resurgence through the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris during the late 19th to early 20th centuries, reflected facades and ornamentation rooted in Vitruvian Principles and Palladian Architecture.
It emphasized formal elegance, symmetry, and grandeur, often featuring facades with balanced proportions flanked by columns (Figure\ref{fig:ClassicismNeoClassicism}).

The Art Nouveau style of the late 19th to early 20th centuries, prominent in Europe, introduced ornamentation and facades with an organic character.
This style, exemplified by figures like Gaudi, drew inspiration from nature's forms and flow lines.
Gaudi's work, for instance, used curvilinear lines that mirrored natural shapes, and mosaic-like tiles mimicking textures and colors of the natural world (Figure\ref{fig:ArtNouveaustyle}).

          \label{fig:ArtNouveaustyle}
        \end{figure}

While the Art Deco style prevalent in Europe and America during in the 1920s to early 1930s will come to rethink Facade and Ornament through the prisms of luxury and technological progress.
This style aimed to capture both modernity and historical nostalgia, resulting in a fusion of futuristic aspirations and references paying homage to the past (Figure\ref{fig:NeoclassicArtDeco}).

%% Figure of Art Deco style  facade

          \label{fig:NeoclassicArtDeco}
        \end{figure}

However, while these styles undoubtedly added depth and variety to architectural aesthetics, they did not bring about the same profound paradigm shifts that would later characterize the Modernist movement.

With this broader context established, the analysis will now shift its focus to the Modernist movement's transformative impact on architectural philosophy.

%%facade according to le corbusier

Transitioning from the Baroque style, where facades became expressions of internal dynamics, and acknowledging the enriched insights from the Neoclassical, Art Nouveau and ArtDeco Style,  the historical evolution of facades and ornamentation takes us into the Modernist style of the 20th century—a pivotal juncture that marked one of the most significant shifts in architectural theory.

 Within this era, a radicalized interpretation of ``Form follows function'' emerged, embodying a profound departure from the conventional understanding of facades and ornamentation, partly due to a prevailing stance against ornamentation, often dismissed on moralistic grounds.

Adolf Loos' 1908 article ``Ornament and Crime'' exemplified this sentiment by advocating functional design and condemning conventional ornamentation as unnecessary\cite{Saglam2014}.

Le Corbusier, one of the most prominent figures of this epoch, and renowned for his influential work ``Towards a New Architecture'' first published in 1923, and considered by some to be the most important architectural work published in the 20th century, epitomized the spirit of the era with his distinct views on facades and ornamentation\cite{Studio2a2023}.

Embracing a minimalist and utilitarian approach, Le Corbusier believed that a facade should mirror a building's internal functions, designed in alignment with its purpose and occupants' needs.

Rooted in a human-centric design philosophy, his mantras ``Constructing the architecture of men'' and ``Men are the ones who truly matter'' underscored his commitment to prioritizing people's well-being in his designs\cite{Virseda2021}.

His manifesto ``The Five Points of a New Architecture'' further solidified his design principles.
The notion of ``Free design of the facade'' attained by separating the exterior of the building from its structural function is presented as the means through which the facade liberates itself from conventional structural\cite{Corbusier1986}.

This allowed for the incorporation of large expanses of windows to provide ample natural light and ventilation, fostering a seamless connection between the interior and exterior realms.

Even during this era when ornamentation was viewed unfavorably, Le Corbusier believes in a form of functional ornamentation, as Venturi\cite{Venturi1972} would later accurately point out, Modern architecture uses expressive ornament and shuns explicit symbolic  ornament.

He would ingeniously devise methods to infuse his creations with a distinct form of ornamentation, albeit one rooted in materials' textures, structural elements, and inventive ways of articulating functionality\cite{Saglam2014} that emerged from the building's design.

For example, he used sunshades, brise-soleil, and other shading devices as a way to address climate and control light without compromising the building's aesthetic integrity.

In essence, Le Corbusier's viewpoint on facades and ornamentation epitomized clarity, rationality, and harmonious integration.
His architecture rejected superfluous adornment, and celebrated both technological advancements and structural innovation while maintaining a genuine focus on the well-being and experiences of the occupants (Figure\ref{fig:Modernistfacade}).

%%facade according to Venturi

However, despite the innovative ideals of the Modernist movement,  it became apparent that its utopian vision didn't always materialize as intended.
While the pursuit of functionalism and simplicity was meant to create efficient and logical designs, the outcomes were not always aligned with the intended human experiences.

The Modernist approach often led to the unintentional creation of spaces that felt monotonous and detached from their cultural contexts.
The emphasis on minimalism and the rejection of ornamentation sometimes resulted in environments lacking a sense of identity and character.

The architectural pursuit of universality and timelessness would instead produce sterile, glass-cube structures\cite{Schudel2018} disregarding the importance of cultural heritage and local context, and inadvertently raise the question: Is the reinvention of form, that rejected explicit symbolism and frivolous applique ornament, inspired by the modernist ideals,  yielding a Heroic and original outcome, or is it, instead, a dry expressionism, empty and boring that has distorted the whole building into one big ornament\cite{Venturi1971}.

This scrutiny of the Modernist movement's inability to adequately encompass human experiences and cultural significance, which sparked controversy during the 1960s, brings us to the influential ideas of architect and theorist Robert Venturi.

Venturi's book ``Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'', published in 1966, marked a turning point in architectural discourse and challenged the prevailing modernist ideals.

Robert Venturi, an iconoclastic architect often hailed as the pioneer of postmodernism\cite{Schudel2018} stood firmly against the oversimplification of architecture, championing the incorporation of contradiction and complexity to yield authentic and vital creations.

The modernist ideals, heavily favoring automobile-centric urban planning, influenced the formation of cities that catered to cars rather than people.
In their thought-provoking book from 1972, "Learning From Las Vegas," Venturi et al.\cite{Venturi1972} put forth a compelling argument, exemplified by the stark contrast seen in places like Las Vegas, they assert that if you were to strip away the dazzling signs, what remains is not a thriving urban environment but a barren desert, illustrating the detachment of architecture relegated to a mere functional necessity camouflaged behind attention-grabbing signs.

Venturi et al.\cite{Venturi1972} will further explain that the oversimplification of architecture, combined with the emergence of sprawling spaces, high speeds, and intricate functions where symbols hold more significance than actual forms, has transformed architecture into symbols occupying space, rather than forming it.

This shift implies that the architectural structure itself carries minimal meaning, with the focus primarily directed towards the signs that communicate with it.

The building stands isolated from the street, often separated by vast parking lots, while the front-facing sign juts out perpendicular to the highway, detached from the building.
At the rear, the structure becomes a utilitarian afterthought, reduced to a budgetary obligation\cite{Venturi1972}.

In this scenario, the absence of signs leaves behind a vacuous atmosphere, characterized by scattered buildings that lack enclosure and cohesion.
The architecture loses its essence, mirroring a cultural void much like a desert devoid of life and enrichment.

The impact of these dynamics is not confined to the past;
instead, they continue to reverberate through the present state of our cities.
Many urban landscapes today still adhere to the principles that emerged from the modernist era.
The prioritization of cars and the resulting sprawling infrastructure persist in shaping cityscapes that often prioritize functionality over human experience.

In response to the challenges posed by the Modernist movement and its unintended consequences, Venturi would reshape the course of architectural discourse.
Notably, he will famously invert the famous dictum of Mies van der Rohe ‘Less is more’ into ‘Less is a bore'\cite{Lutolli2020}, encapsulating his bold departure from the prevailing architectural norms.

In his book ``Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture''\cite{Venturi1977}, Venturi emphasized that architecture should be responsive to the cultural context and the people who inhabit it.

His viewpoint marked a departure from the rigid modernist principles who shunned symbolism of form as an expression or reinforcement of content that dictated that architectural form was to be determined solely by program and structure, with an  occasional  assist from  intuition\cite{Venturi1972}, instead he proposed a reevaluation of the role of ornament and complexity in architectural design (Figure\ref{fig:postmodernfacade}).

          \label{fig:postmodernfacade}
        \end{figure}

On this context, Venturi believed that a facade could communicate various meanings, evoke emotions, and respond to its cultural and contextual surroundings.
Venturi emphasized the richness of symbolism within architecture, asserting that symbols were fundamental in the architectural language, advocating for the integration of elements from historical precedents and the existing urban fabric, treating them as source materials that could be intelligently referenced or replicated to inform the design process\cite{Venturi1971}.
Importantly, Venturi's approach did not solely prioritize outward appearance;
it was deeply intertwined with the functional aspects of a building's interior, aligning with his belief that architecture should serve both utilitarian purposes and evoke meaningful experiences.

Regarding ornament, he argued that ornamentation was not inherently negative but should be used judiciously and meaningfully.
Venturi coined phrase ``Less is a bore'', suggests his approach towards ornament in what he would describe as ``the decorated shed''\cite{Venturi1972} that architecture doesn't have to be stripped of ornamentation to be considered valid.
He encouraged architects to embrace complexity, contradiction, and the richness of historical references in their designs.

In other words, Robert Venturi's views on facades and ornament emphasized the importance of embracing diversity, historical references, and meaning in architectural design, he wants modern architects to realize only one thing— perfection in the architectural world can and should include imperfection, in all its forms\cite{Lutolli2020}.
This eclectic and innovative design inspired from the return to the ornamentation of the past pushed the boundaries of architecture in the 20th century\cite{Stamp2016}.

In essence, Robert Venturi's perspective on facades and ornamentation underscored the significance of welcoming diversity, historical resonance, and meaningful expression within architectural design.

His vision urged contemporary architects to recognize a crucial reality—perfection within the architectural realm is not confined to flawless forms but also encompasses the beauty found in imperfection, across its myriad manifestations\cite{Lutolli2020}.

This eclectic and innovative approach, which drew inspiration from a renewed appreciation for historical ornamentation, boldly expanded the horizons of architectural exploration throughout the 20th century\cite{Stamp2016} paving the way for the bold explorations and boundary-pushing experiments that would characterize the late 20th century.
