The `Complexity Analysis' system addresses the challenge of quantifying complexity in architectural facade design, playing a pivotal role in our study.
To achieve this, we developed a process that integrates immersive VR experiences with CV algorithms embedded in the CICA system (see Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchartComplexity}, element 3.1).
This approach enables real-time interaction with various facade designs while providing complexity data, offering comprehensive insights into the aesthetic and practical implications of architectural complexity.

The system comprises three integral components: `\textit{3D Modeling and Environment Setup}', `\textit{CICA System}', and `\textit{VR Integration and Simulation Tools}'.
These components are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchartComplexity} (labeled 1 to 3) and are detailed in the following sections.

%begin{enumerate}
%\item \textit{3D Modeling and Environment Setup:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:3DModeling} (element 1 in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}), this component is responsible for creating realistic 3D representations of the experiment site and ten distinct facade variations across three patterns for user interaction.
%
%\item \textit{CICA System:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:CICAsystem} (Element 2 in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}), this system generates complexity scores for 3D-modeled facades and photographs of historic and existing buildings.
%This systematic approach evaluates and selects facade designs for the VR experience and conducts a historical complexity analysis of buildings across various styles.
%
%\item \textit{VR Integration and Simulation Tools:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:VR_integration} (element 3 in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}), this component offers an immersive simulation with a data visualization interface.
%Participants can navigate the virtual space, experiencing the building and its surroundings, and interact with various facade designs.
%Real-time feedback enhances this interaction by showing the impact of different facade variations.
