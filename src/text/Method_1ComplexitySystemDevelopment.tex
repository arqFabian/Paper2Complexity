The `Complexity Analysis' system addresses the challenge of quantifying complexity in architectural facade design, playing a pivotal role in our study.
To achieve this, we developed a process that integrates immersive VR experiences with CV algorithms embedded in the CICA system (see Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchartComplexity}, element 3.1).
This approach enables real-time interaction with various facade designs while providing complexity data, offering comprehensive insights into the aesthetic and practical implications of architectural complexity.

The system comprises three integral components: `\textit{3D Modeling and Environment Setup}', `\textit{CICA System}', and `\textit{VR Integration and Simulation Tools}'.
These components are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchartComplexity} (labeled 1 to 3) and are detailed in the following sections.
