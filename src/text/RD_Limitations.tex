\textbf{Limitations}

The findings of this research provide valuable insights, however, it is important to interpret the results with caution due to certain limitations.

However, it's essential to recognize that every research endeavor carries its unique set of limitations, and our study is no exception.
In the spirit of transparency, we candidly acknowledge these limitations, which we will address.
Nevertheless, the following subsections, which meticulously analyze our results, were arranged in accordance with the core themes and research questions that guided our inquiry.

        %The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the potential of VR immersion in data-driven design for Site Layout Planning, as well as potential implications for other areas of the building design process. However, it is important to interpret the results with caution due to certain limitations. The generalizability of the findings is limited by the small sample size and the fact that the participants were limited to individuals affiliated with the university.

        %Furthermore, the experiment design aimed to simulate the current methodology used in addressing SLP through a "screen-based interaction" stage, which involved CAD plans, perspectives, and expert recommendations typically provided to design teams.

        %However, the introduction of data visualization techniques and charts was exclusive to the "VR stage" (see Figure \ref{fig:VRinterface}). As a result, it is challenging to determine the exact contribution of VR-based interaction versus more efficient data visualization techniques to the observed accuracy improvement. It can be speculated that if the same graphs and interface used in the VR stage were introduced to the screen-based stage, the observed accuracy improvement may have been different.
