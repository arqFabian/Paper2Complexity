The final phase of our methodology involves a detailed analysis of the data collected during the experiments, crucial for validating the effectiveness of the `Complexity Analysis' system in evaluating facades.

It is structured as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Data Processing and Analysis:} ...Advanced statistical tools
    \item \textit{Performance Evaluation:} We assess the `Complexity Analysis' system's impact on user by examining:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Accuracy Analysis:} ...
            \item \textit{Participant Perception Survey:} ...
        \end{itemize}

        These metrics are critical

    \item \textit{Results Interpretation and Reporting:} Data synthesis ...
\end{enumerate}
