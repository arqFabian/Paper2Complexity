To address the central inquiry of this research – ``How do users respond to complex facades crafted with digital fabrication, as assessed through virtual reality, and how does this insight shape forthcoming architectural trends?'' – the methodology unfolds in three distinct sections: Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) system, VR Building Complexity System Development, and Experiment Design.
This workflow is illustrated in Figure\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}.

The first component, Computational Image complexity analysis (CICA) system involves the development of a Python script tailored to process images systematically, yielding complexity scores that quantitatively gauge the intricacy of architectural designs.
This component serves a dual purpose: corroborating the theoretical architectural style analyses established on the theory framework section and also as an initial framework to rank a series of facades designs to be used on the VR system to compare participants perceptions in an experiment mimicking various complexity levels in building facades.

The second component, VR Building Complexity System Development, revolves around the creation of a Virtual Reality (VR) system designed to immerse users within a building environment.
Within this virtual realm, users possess the capability to manipulate facade complexity across ten discrete levels, a hierarchy determined by the Computational Image Complexity Analysis (CICA) system.

In the third section, the experiment design determines the method used to evaluate the level of complexity that users of a building would accept.
Following a similar approach to previous studies using VR assessment\cite{Wolfartsberger2019}, a group of participants was invited to engage in an experiment to measure Building Complexity perception across three distinct stages: The ``VR interaction stage'' through the use of Virtual reality simulation using a Heads-up Display (HUD), the ``Screen based Image ranking stage'' and the ``Post-interaction survey'' stage.
No prior experience in facade design was required from participants.

This methodology combines computational analysis with immersive virtual reality experiments to understand user preferences in facade design, contributing insights into future architectural trends.
