%% Research Background

%% A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article already dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation for further work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical development from a theoretical basis.

%A theoretical framework is a foundational review of existing theories that serves as a roadmap for developing the arguments you will use in your own work.

%% Introduction

%!Concise intro

This section delves into the multifaceted nature of architectural complexity, examining its historical evolution and the theoretical foundations that underpin contemporary architectural practices.
It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how complexity influences both design practices and user experiences.
The literature review is organized into two key themes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Evolution of Architectural Styles:} focusing on the historical transitions between simplicity and complexity in architecture, highlighting significant shifts across different periods.
    \item \textit{Theoretical Foundations of Architectural Complexity:} exploring foundational theories and previous research surrounding complexity in architecture, offering insights into how these theories inform current design practices.
\end{itemize}

These insights are crucial for validating the CICA findings by comparing empirical data with theoretical perspectives on architectural evolution, thereby confirming observed patterns of simplicity and complexity.

%This section focuses on four key themes:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Evolution and Theoretical Foundations of Architectural Complexity: Explores the historical context and foundational theories of complexity in architecture, including Birkhoff's ratio of order to complexity.
%    \item Technological Advancements: Analyzes the impact of BIM, digital fabrication, and VR on architectural design and user perception.
%    \item User Perception and Quantitative Analysis of Complexity: Investigates the psychological and physiological impacts of complexity on users, principles of biophilic design, and gaps in aligning data-driven design with user satisfaction.
%    This includes quantitative methods and computational studies on complexity.
%    \item Gaps in Current Research: Identifies the existing gaps in the research, highlighting the need for comprehensive frameworks that integrate theoretical principles with practical applications, and discusses the challenges and opportunities of rapidly advancing technologies.
