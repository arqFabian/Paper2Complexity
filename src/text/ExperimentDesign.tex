The experiment is designed to comprehensively measure the response of participant to increasingly complex facade variations through Virtual Reality (VR) simulations using a Heads-Up mounted display Heads mo Display (HUD) on the decision-making to quantitatively and qualitatively measure the level of tolerance of users of a building to complex envelop design (see Figure\ref{fig:ExperimentFlowchart}).

It consists of three distinct stages: the `VR interaction' stage, the `Screen-based ranking' stage, and the `Post-experiment Survey' stage.
