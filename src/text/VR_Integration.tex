Finally, the `Virtual reality integration' module, developed in Unity, serves as the third critical component.
This module includes an immersive simulation and a data visualization interface that transports users into the VR simulation of the experiment's location for facade complexity analysis.

Within this dynamic virtual environment, participants can explore and interact with the building from both inside and outside, visualize its context, and manipulate the facade variations through the user interface.

Seamlessly integrated with the simulation, the interface provides real-time feedback on the impact of different facade variations on the building, facilitating more effective and informed decision-making when selecting a specific level of complexity.
