The methodology of this study, comprises three main components (subdivided into 5 key steps, as illustrated in  Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchartComplexity}):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Complexity Analysis System Development:} Outlined in Section~\ref{subsec:ComplexitySystemDevelopment} (Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchartComplexity}, element 3.1), this component integrates a VR framework with the CICA system.~The CICA system uses CV algorithms to quantitatively assess facade design complexity, applied to both contemporary 3D-modeled facades and historical analysis.~The VR component allows real-time participant interaction with facade variations, combining 3D models and CICA analysis. Key elements include the 3D modeling process (Section~\ref{subsubsec:3DModeling}, Figure~\ref{fig:modeling_flowchart}), the CICA system (Section~\ref{subsubsec:CICAsystem}, Figure~\ref{fig:CICA_and_VR_flowchart}), and VR integration (Section~\ref{subsubsec:VR_integration}, Figure~\ref{fig:CICA_and_VR_flowchart}).

    \item \textit{Experiment Execution:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:Experiment_execution} (Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchartComplexity}, element 3.2), this phase involves participants engaging with the `Complexity Analysis' system through three stages: `VR Interaction' Stage, `Screen-Based Ranking' Stage, and `Post-Experiment Survey'. This process combines quantitative CICA scores and qualitative user feedback.

    \item \textit{Data Analysis and Validation:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:Data_analysis} (Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchartComplexity}, element 3.3), this final component analyzes both CICA scores and experiment data to validate the systemâ€™s effectiveness in measuring complexity and user preferences. Statistical tools are used to evaluate the alignment between CICA scores and user perceptions. The system's accuracy and its application to historical and contemporary facades are assessed through detailed complexity analysis, providing insights for architectural design practices.
\end{enumerate}

With the methodology outlined, we now move forward to a comprehensive breakdown of each component.

%\textbf{CICA system:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:CICAsystem} and depicted as (3.1) in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, involves developing a Python script using computer vision algorithms to process images and yield complexity scores, quantitatively gauging the intricacy of architectural designs.
%It supports theoretical analyses and provides a ranking framework for facade designs in the VR system.
%
%\textbf{VR System Development:}  Outlined in Section~\ref{subsec:VRsystemDevelopment} and represented as (3.2) in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, this component focuses on creating an immersive experience where participants can explore and interact with a building's interior and exterior, manipulating facade designs with variable complexity levels and experiencing their impact.
%
%\textbf{Experiment Execution:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:Experiment_execution} and illustrated as (3.3) in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, following a similar approach to previous studies~\cite{Wolfartsberger2019}, this component outlines the method to evaluate users' acceptance of building complexity.
%It consists of three stages: a VR interaction stage, a screen-based stage, and a post-interaction survey.
%These stages allow for the collection of quantitative and qualitative data on participants' perceptions and responses to different complexity levels in facade designs.
%
%As illustrated in the methodology flowchart (Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}), these components are combined to integrate computational analysis with immersive VR experiments, exploring user preferences in facade design and providing insights into architectural trends.

%With this methodology outlined, the following sections will now delve into a comprehensive breakdown of each component, highlighting their objectives, methodologies, and significance in achieving our research goals.
