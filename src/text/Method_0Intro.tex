The methodology of this study, comprises three main components (as illustrated in  Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Complexity Analysis System Development:}  Outlined in Section~\ref{subsec:ComplexitySystemDevelopment} and illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart} (element 3.1), this component integrates the VR and CICA systems to create an immersive environment for evaluating facade complexities.
    \item \textit{Experiment Execution:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:Experiment_execution} and illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart} (element 3.2), involves the deployment of the VR component of the `Complexity Analysis' system in a controlled scenario to evaluate users' perception and response to different complexity levels in facade designs.
    \item \textit{Data Analysis and Validation:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:Data_analysis} and illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart} (element 3.3), this component analyzes the collected data to validate the VR system and CICA framework's effectiveness in measuring complexity and users' acceptance of building complexity.
\end{enumerate}

With the methodology outlined, we now move forward to a comprehensive breakdown of each component.


%\textbf{CICA system:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:CICAsystem} and depicted as (3.1) in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, involves developing a Python script using computer vision algorithms to process images and yield complexity scores, quantitatively gauging the intricacy of architectural designs.
%It supports theoretical analyses and provides a ranking framework for facade designs in the VR system.
%
%\textbf{VR System Development:}  Outlined in Section~\ref{subsec:VRsystemDevelopment} and represented as (3.2) in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, this component focuses on creating an immersive experience where participants can explore and interact with a building's interior and exterior, manipulating facade designs with variable complexity levels and experiencing their impact.
%
%\textbf{Experiment Execution:} Detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:Experiment_execution} and illustrated as (3.3) in Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, following a similar approach to previous studies~\cite{Wolfartsberger2019}, this component outlines the method to evaluate users' acceptance of building complexity.
%It consists of three stages: a VR interaction stage, a screen-based stage, and a post-interaction survey.
%These stages allow for the collection of quantitative and qualitative data on participants' perceptions and responses to different complexity levels in facade designs.
%
%As illustrated in the methodology flowchart (Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}), these components are combined to integrate computational analysis with immersive VR experiments, exploring user preferences in facade design and providing insights into architectural trends.
%
%With this methodology outlined, the following sections will now delve into a comprehensive breakdown of each component, highlighting their objectives, methodologies, and significance in achieving our research goals.
