We evidence this when observing the Romanesque classical style on the 10 th century found mostly in churches ith thick wall structures, followed by the breakthrough in load distribution during the Gothic style of the 12th to the 16th century which abandons the robustness to erect high buildings with complex great stained windows.
The Renaissance follows at the end of the middle ages and with it the return of the classical order with round arch and classical order columns that brings ornaments back to the interior in favour of more simplified exteriors. In reaction to this style Baroque style surges with more dynamic forms , irregular shapes and exagerated ornamentation in bold combinations.
