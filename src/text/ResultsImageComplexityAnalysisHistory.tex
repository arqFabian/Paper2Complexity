We have previously discussed the argument that architectural evolution, throughout history, has been characterized by a continual interplay between simplicity and complexity.
Our literature review, in Section \ref{sec:Literature review} has consistently pointed towards a prevailing trend in contemporary architecture, suggesting a resurgence of complexity in architectural design.
However, to ensure our findings are not purely subjective or biased towards this conclusion, we have conducted a quantitative analysis using the CICA system.
This rigorous analysis method utilizes input images of the most iconic and representative buildings from various epochs and styles.
Over 180 buildings

The results are visually depicted in Figure\ref{fig:HistoricalComplexityGraph}, where a discernible upward trendline towards complexity emerges, particularly noticeable since the late 20th century.
