We have previously discussed that architectural evolution has been characterized by a continual interplay between simplicity and complexity.
Our literature review, presented in Section \ref{sec:Literature review}, has consistently pointed towards a prevailing trend in contemporary architecture, suggesting a resurgence of complexity in architectural design.

To objectively validate this trend, we conducted a quantitative analysis using the CICA system.
This rigorous analysis method utilizes input images of the most iconic and representative buildings from various epochs and styles, totaling 177 buildings across 14 architectural styles(illustrated in timelines in Figure \ref{fig:Oldtimeline}, \ref{fig:Middletimeline}, \ref{fig:contemporarytimeline}).
The CICA system took only 4.54 seconds to calculate the CICA scores for all the buildings and plot the graph, demonstrating its efficiency for complexity analysis.

The results are visually depicted in Figure \ref{fig:HistoricalComplexityGraph}, where a discernible upward trendline towards complexity emerges, particularly noticeable since the late 20th century.
