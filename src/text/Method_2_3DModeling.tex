To achieve realistic VR experiences for assessing user responses to facade complexity, a building site and facade variations were 3D modeled using Blender (v3.6).
Blender was selected for its advanced rendering capabilities, support for parametric and generative design, and seamless Python integration, necessary for integrating it with the CICA and VR components of the `Complexity Analysis' system.

The `building site' used for this study is a detailed virtual replica of the Architectural Environment Research Building at Kyushu University, Fukuoka-Japan, including both exterior and interior elements of the existing building (Figure~\ref{fig:RealVs3dModel}). This building was chosen because it is the location where this study takes place, contributing significantly to the sense of immersion for participants during the experiment.

To test the response of occupants to various degrees of complexity, ten facade variations across three different patterns were 3D modeled and strategically placed over the large windows of the `building site' for maximum visual impact.
These variations systematically increase in complexity by applying 3D modeling operations from simple subdivisions to advanced modifications like rotations and decimation, ensuring a diverse dataset as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:PatternsVariationsPart0} and further detailed in~\ref{sec:AnnexVariations}.
Each facade variation is rendered and labeled for use in the CICA complexity analysis, ensuring control over complexity variability%~(setup illustrated in  Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart}, element 1).
This setup (illustrated in  Figure~\ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchartComplexity}, element 1), provides a comprehensive environment for analyzing the accuracy of the `Complexity Analysis' system and investigating user perception.


%Achieving realistic 3D modeling is crucial for this study to replicate an authentic experience in VR, especially when assessing user responses to facade complexity.
%Using Blender (v3.6), our 3D modeling components creates a virtual replica of the Architectural Environment Research Building at Kyushu University, chosen as the experiment's set.
%This replica encompasses both exterior and interior details, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RealVs3dModel}.
%
%This component generates ten facade variations across three different patterns, positioned over the building's large windows for maximum visual impact (Figure~\ref{fig:VRInteriorExterior}). These 3 sets of variations, one for each pattern, are created systematically, with each level introducing greater complexity.
%The progression of complexity levels is illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:PatternsVariationsPart0} and fully detailed in~\ref{sec:AnnexVariations}.
%The operations for generating complexity, from base patterns in facade design, range from simple subdivision at the initial levels to more advanced modifications such as rotations, bends, and decimations at higher levels.
%
%Each variation is rendered and labeled for use in the CICA complexity analysis.
%This ensures control over the variability of complexity across the variations, using the CICA complexity score as a reference to guarantee diversity in the data pool of facades for the VR experiment.
%This diversity is evidenced in the scatter graph of facade complexity analysis per pattern in Figure~\ref{fig:CICAscatterGraphRender}.
%
%The 3D modeling component also includes a script for exporting these variations to FBX format, facilitating integration with the VR system.
%This detailed and systematic approach to 3D modeling ensures that the VR simulations accurately reflect real-world conditions, providing participants with a realistic and immersive experience during the experiment.
