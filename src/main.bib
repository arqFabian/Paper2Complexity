   abstract = {The concept of ornament has emerged as a result of the existence of the human being and its relation to its environment. Ornament of objects, which aim at adding qualitative features to objects alongside their quantitative states, is a practice that is as old as humanity. Within this process of the individual's efforts in thinking, designing, creating, and communicating, one comes across ornament in every field of design, from little objects to urban planning. Discussions especially on architectural ornament has been popular in every age. Since the time of Vitruvius who set the stage for conceptual discussion of architecture, ornament, due to its social and psychological functions, has almost uninterruptedly been a major topic for discussion. This can be seen as the language's (that is used to perceive and narrate architecture as a spatial art) benefitting from formal-physical elements (which are mostly rather found on a more superficial and easily understood level) of artistic communication. Ornament, whose function-meaning and/or form go through changes according to ages, within the context of architecture, where it belongs to the highest level of artistic communication language, has been at the core of these discussions. The aim of this paper is to re-evaluate architecture-ornament relation within history and to re-discuss it in a rather popular way by drawing attention to the most controversial climaxes in new architectural perspective.},

   abstract = {The building facade is the main visible element of a building, acting as a boundary between the interior and the exterior environment. The facade works as an interface between the living spaces and the external climate, influencing comfort and energy efficiency. The skins of these facades are important media between the interior and exterior of a building. They not only connect between users and environments, but also play an important functional and aesthetic role. The major advancements in facade technology gives the architects and specialists the opportunity to vary the appearance of the building envelope, create an integrate grid system with all of their ideas, such as, windows, ventilation elements, glazing, aluminum features, etc. while maintaining a high level weather proofing. The objective of this paper is to identify, investigate and understand the recent innovations in the material science which have been incorporated in facades, especially in high rise buildings. In this paper, a qualitative evaluation research method is used. The research methodology comprises of case studies, visual observation and data collection. The various modern trends in the development of facade material employed in contemporary architecture around the world have been also been discussed through some examples in this paper.},

The dual effects of reducing building energy consumption and improving indoor thermal comfort can be achieved by adopting a passive design in a reasonable manner. High-performance sustainable building facades are exterior enclosures that use the least possible amount of energy to maintain a comfortable interior environment, which promotes the health and productivity of the building's occupants. The objective of the research is to investigate and understand the high performance building facade systems, especially employed in tall buildings in present day contemporary architecture. In this paper, a qualitative evaluation research method is used. The research methodology comprises of case studies, visual observation and data collection.

@article{Benjamin2006,
   abstract = {The argument in this paper is that surface should be understood neither as a merely structural, nor as a merely decorative aspect of building. Rather, the creation of surfaces (interior walls or fa√ßades and so on) organises a programme which allows for a reading of the space of architecture. The latter formulation‚Äîthe space of architecture‚Äîhas a double register. On the one hand, it refers to the specific architectural works, to particular buildings, and how they effect and affect the subject. On the other hand, it makes a broader, theoretical point about the way that architecture is conceived as an effect of the possibilities inherent in the materials used in the making of surfaces. The argument is advanced through an engagement with work by Borromini, Semper and Loos.

   abstract = {"Constructing the architecture of men" or "men are the ones who truly matters" are phrases that Le Corbusier repeats frequently. His work could be understood as a consequence of his understanding of "this man" and the social order he supports. Both ideas evolve throughout the life of the architect and as a consequence so will the artistic and architectural proposals realized in his name.The Homme type Le Corbusier of the 20s and 30s is conceived under the influence of the industrial revolution of the first decades of the 20th century as another piece in the precise gear of the great machinery in the city of the new times. The failure of the social and economic approaches, represented by the two world wars, as well as some determined personal circumstances provoke a progressive variation of this vision towards a conception of man in opposite terms. The Homme type varies progressively towards the Homme réel of the postwar period whose development upholds new variables including "freedom, "spontaneity" and "creativity." It was in the decade of the 50s, in the convent of la Tourette, where he finally realizes the opportunity to reflect and to present in a dual manner his ideals of men and architecture.},
